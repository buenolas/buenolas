## About Me
Hi, I'm Lucas de Almeida Bueno. I'm 21 years old and live in GoiÃ¢nia-GO, Brazil. I'm currently in the sixth semester of my Computer Science course at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, set to graduate in December 2026. I've always been fascinated by technology, computers, and video games. As a child, when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answer was always "a scientist!" Now, I'm on my way to becoming a computer scientist, doing what I love.
